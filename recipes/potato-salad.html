    <img src="../images/Potato-salad-italian.jpg">
    <h4>Description</h4>
   <p>
    One of the easiest and healthiest potato salad you will find. This one has no mayo or cream bases, it simply has the Mediterranean flavour of garlic and olive oil enhanced with fresh herbs and lemon. Couldn’t be simpler. The secret is using the kipfler potatoes, there’s simply no better potato for potato salad. if you can’t find kipfler, then use a waxy variety. You can use dried oregano but the chives need to be fresh. If you can’t find chives, then use spring (green) onion.
